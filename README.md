# Deliverable Three

## Overview of Election Audit
The goal of the analysis of the election audit was to analyze the results of the 2019 election.  We were looking to breakdown the ballots by both the county they were cast in, as well as by who they were cast for.  In order to do this, we created a script in python that was able to calculate the total amount of votes, where they were cast, and who they were cast for.  That analysis made us able to determine how mnay votes each candidate received, and from which county those votes came from.
